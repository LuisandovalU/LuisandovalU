# 👋 Hi! I'm Luis Alberto

I am a **Computer Engineering** student with a great passion for learning and growing in the world of technology 💻. I am currently part of the **Oracle Next Education (ONE)** program, where I am learning **JavaScript development**, while continuing to strengthen my knowledge in **Python** 🐍.

I like to use my free time to explore new tools, practice programming, and prepare myself to contribute to projects that have a positive impact 🚀.

## 💼 Previous Experience

Before focusing on the technology field, I worked as a **supervisor** at **Starbucks ☕** and **Wildfork 🍖**. During this time, I developed skills that I consider valuable in the IT world as well:

-   Team management 🤝
-   Resource administration 💼
-   Time planning ⏰
-   Staff training 🎓
-   Decision-making under pressure ⚡

### Why work with me? 🤔

I am a student **motivated to learn** 📚, **proactive** 💡, and with the ability to **adapt quickly** to new challenges ⚡. My experience in management has given me a practical perspective on project management and teamwork, skills I consider fundamental for growth in the IT area 🌱.

I am looking for **my first professional opportunity in technology** 💼, where I can continue to learn, apply my current knowledge in **programming**, and contribute to a team's success with my experience in **team management**.

### Contributions I'm proud of 🌟

Although I am just beginning my journey as a developer, I have started working on some personal projects using **JavaScript** and **Python** 🐍, and I have been fortunate to participate in **student communities** and learning groups where I can share my knowledge and learn from others who are in the same process 📈.
